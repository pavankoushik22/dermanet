# DermaNet

This repository is the official implementation of [Derma Net: An Automated Skin Lesion
Analyzer Using CNN with Adaptive Learning](https://www.ijitee.org/wp-content/uploads/papers/v8i6s4/F11070486S419.pdf). 



## Training

To train the model in the paper, run this command:

```train
python dermanet2-0.ipynb
```

>ðŸ“‹  This application is meant for commodity level devices such as mobiles we preferred MobileNet model and transfer learning to train on our dataset.


## Pre-trained Models

You can download pretrained models here:

- [DermaNet model](https://github.com/thepavankoushik/dermanet/blob/master/jscript/model.json) trained on MobileNet.


## Results

Our model achieves the following performance on :
